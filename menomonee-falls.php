        <p class="info">Our kids program teaches kids of all skills and abilities. Younger kids are encouraged to learn structure, discipline and most importantly boundaries.  Older and more experienced kids will further develop strengths and overcome weaknesses. We will push kids to explore their limits but remain mindful that not everyone is created equal, each student has unique strengths and it’s at this point we try to bring these out.  Of course we practice techniques, but without establishing these virtues, it’s difficult to create and foster a positive learning environment. We are, after all, setting the groundwork, not only for future martial arts classes, but for other areas of their lives.</p>

        <p class="info">Adult classes are designed for physically and emotionally mature individuals who are ready to learn both basic and advanced techniques.   We will work on both basic and advanced techniques, we sometime work together or apart depending on class make up.  This is a great environment to foster relationships and work one on one to improve your skill set, we are a community where camaraderie flourishes and friendships are formed.</p>
